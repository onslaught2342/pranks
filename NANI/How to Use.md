# 🧠 NANI Toast Meme Script

Ever wanted to hit your desktop (or a friend's) with a surprise **"Omae wa mou shindeiru... NANI?!"** pop-up toast?  
This PowerShell script does exactly that — clean, safe, and totally for educational purposes (of course).

---

## ❗Using the Script is Extremely Easy

Just run this command:

```powershell

```

If you're unsure or a security geek, please ask ChatGPT and confirm your superstitions.
Huge respects. Do not bully others.

## 🔥 What It Does

- Downloads a legendary NANI?! reaction image (only once)
- Installs the `BurntToast` module (only if missing)
- Pops a Windows toast notification with:

  ```
  OMAEE WA MOU SHINDEIRU
  N A N I ?! 🔥💀
  ```

- Looks innocent — like “study.ps1”. Totally meme-safe™.
